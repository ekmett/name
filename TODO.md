* Provide code for converting trees <-> a prefix of the naturals as an `STArray`.

* Prove I can implement the Gordon Complementary Bijection Principle (GCBP) in O(n log n) time using those two things, and by repeated
  "squerging" on the flat array representation, which would improve the time bound from Yorgey and Foner's O(n^2 log n).
  Probably publishable. [gcbp]

* Find a use for the GCBP in nominal logic! It should be a usable nominal morphism. "Effective" is the same as nominal,
  replace the word "support" with "stabilizer" and everything transfers from Feldman and Propp.

* Let's re-examine support.

  Support is, effectively, a vocabulary for talking about stabilizers.

  `G(x) = { y ∈ X | y = g.x, g ∈ G }` is the orbit of `x ∈ X` under `G`.

  `G_x = { g ∈ G | g.x = x }` is the stabilizer of `x` in G.

  `G(x) = G/G_x` and the group's action on `G_x` is transitive.

  Classically (no pun intended) minimal support is computable. In practice, for computer science needs a finite superset of support
  suffices, but at the cost of transitivity.

  We normally (no pun intended) talk about support in terms of sets of atoms that if you hold them in place, πx=x.

  It seems to me that this isn't the right notion!

  Consider centralizers and normalizers,

  `C_G(A) = { g ∈ G | ∀a ∈ A, gag⁻¹=a }` is the centralizer of `A` in `G`

  `N_G(A) = { g ∈ G | gA = Ag }` is the normalizer of `A` in `G`

  `C_G(A) ⊆ N_G(A) ⊆ G`

  All of the literature on nominal sets I can find actually only talks about support, which speaks to stabilizers, to get at centralizers.

  In general, this seems to make sense, for single atoms, `C_G(a) = N_G(a)`!

  But consider sets of atoms, not to be confused by the sets in the category Set which are being acted on by permutations in Nom.
  e.g. the `Set` type in `Nominal.Set`. Those are stable under the larger class `N_G(A)`. You can permute elements in their support,
  you can permute elements outside of their support, but don't cross the boundary in any cycle.

  Properly talking about their support is effectively talking about partitions that we'd have to respect on atoms. Properly computing
  minimal support here should be computing `N_G(S)` for the set S of atoms they cover, not `C_G(S)`.

  How to represent such a partitioning in such a way that it can be glued together with other supports?

  I've already gained some benefit from this view in the code for `instance Perm Set`

  This also might point to some use for the GCBP in nominal logic. Why? It provides us a way to enforce respect for such boundaries
  in a nominal-logic compatible manner. This might be publishable.

* Wire the concat plugin up to "Nom", with whatever changes I really need in order to build some kind of alpha-Haskell/fresh-haskell.
  Not sure how robust the compiling to categories stuff is though.

* Implement nominal unification through higher order pattern unification. O(n^2)

* Build NominalFunctor and instances for Tie, Suspended, etc.

* Do we really need arbitrary permutations on Atoms? All operations could get by with just the ability to find something outside
  joint support that can be swapped in.

* What does `guanxi` need to be able to support nominal logic programming a la `α-kanren`?

* None of the algorithms in Feldman and Propp [feldman] (which generalize the GCBP) care about the choice of group, really. What other groups
  would be interesting to consider? I already use a (trivial) group action in coda for changes in file position. It unfortunately
  has exactly one generator, so supports are never interesting. However, it does mean you could talk about unification modulo
  shifts in position. It also suggests using independence of source positions via permutations on positions as a more direct analogue to names.

* Can I rephrase things like unification in terms of this same sort of orbit like vocabulary? If we view substitutions as a monoid
  acting on a set, then I can use the same scheme I use in coda to get explicit substitutions as a "slowing" of the usual substitution
  function. Then we can look at the orbits of that monoid. Now the relation isn't symmetric, but it is reflexive and transitive (a quasi-order).
  Given there are only finitely many "coarser" trees with variables at the leaves, it should be a well-quasi-order.
  (This is way cheaper than Kruskal's tree theorem!). An mgu of two terms x and y is something like finding m and n in M such that
  z = m.x = n.y and the orbit of z is the largest possible such orbit. Being a wqo, this should always be doable, as enumerating the
  frontier that describes it can always terminate. I'm curious if this can be used to describe generalized unification algorithms
  in a nicer way. (It probably already has, wqo's are everywhere, and the (extended) strong orbit algorithm is known to generalize to
  monoids.) [orbits]
